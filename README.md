# Na-ve-bayes-algorithm-to-classify-the-fetal-health-
Fetal Health classification Fetal_health.csv dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams (Cardiotocogram is equipment used to read data about the fetus using ultrasound pulses, data like fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more), fetal health was then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:  Normal  Suspect  Pathological The dataset consists of 22 columns as follow:  Baseline value(Baseline Fetal Heart Rate)  accelerations(Number of acceleration per sec)  fetal_movements(Number of Fetal movements per sec)  uterine_contractions(Number of uterine contractions per sec)  light_decelerations(Number of light decelerations per sec)  severe_decelerations (Number of severe decelerations per sec)  prolongued_decelerations( Number of prolongued decelerations per sec)  abnormal_short_term_variability(Percentage of time with abnormal short term variability)  mean_value_of_short_term_variability  Percentage of time with abnormal long term variability  Mean value of long term variability  histogram_width(Width of the histogram made using all values from a record)  histogram_min(Histogram minimum value)  histogram_max(Histogram maximum value)  histogram_number_of_peaks(Number of peaks in the exam histogram)  histogram_number_of_zeroes(Number of zeros in the exam histogram)  histogram_mode  histogram_mean  histogram_median  histogram_variance  histogram_tendency fetal_health(values are 1 for Normal, 2 for suspect and 3 for pathological) It’s required to do the following: 1. Randomly select 30% of the dataset records and save them into fetal-healthTestData.csv file 2. Design and Implement a Naïve bayes algorithm to classify the fetal health using the 21 features above(i.e. baseline value, accelerations, fetal_movements … and so on) 3. Use the extracted Test data records from Step 1 to test your implemented algorithm.
